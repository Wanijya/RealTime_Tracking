# Real-Time Tracking System

A real-time tracking system inspired by Uber and Ola maps. This project demonstrates the use of various technologies to create a map that updates in real-time. It uses `Socket.io` for real-time communication, `Leaflet` for interactive maps, and `Node.js` with `Express` for the backend server.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: See updates on the map in real-time.
- **Interactive Maps**: Utilize Leaflet for a dynamic map experience.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Real-time bi-directional communication between the client and the server.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express for scalability and performance.

## Technologies Used

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Map APIs](#)

## Installation

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

4. **Open your browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the map.

## Usage

- **Real-Time Updates**: As you move or change locations, the map updates in real-time to reflect your current position.
- **Interactive Map**: You can zoom in/out and move around the map to explore different areas.
